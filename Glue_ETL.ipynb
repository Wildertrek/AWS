    "\n",
    "AWS Glue is a fully managed ETL (extract, transform, and load) service that makes it simple and cost-effective to categorize your data, clean it, enrich it, and move it reliably between various data stores and data streams. AWS Glue consists of a central metadata repository known as the AWS Glue Data Catalog, an ETL engine that automatically generates Python or Scala code, and a flexible scheduler that handles dependency resolution, job monitoring, and retries. AWS Glue is serverless, so there’s no infrastructure to set up or manage.\n",
    "\n",
    "AWS Glue is designed to work with semi-structured data. It introduces a component called a dynamic frame, which you can use in your ETL scripts. A dynamic frame is similar to an Apache Spark dataframe, which is a data abstraction used to organize data into rows and columns, except that each record is self-describing so no schema is required initially. With dynamic frames, you get schema flexibility and a set of advanced transformations specifically designed for dynamic frames. You can convert between dynamic frames and Spark dataframes, so that you can take advantage of both AWS Glue and Spark transformations to do the kinds of analysis that you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the AWS Glue console to discover data, transform it, and make it available for search and querying. The console calls the underlying services to orchestrate the work required to transform your data. You can also use the AWS Glue API operations to interface with AWS Glue services. Edit, debug, and test your Python or Scala Apache Spark ETL code using a familiar development environment.\n",

    "__You can use AWS Glue to organize, cleanse, validate, and format data for storage in a data warehouse or data lake__. You can transform and move AWS Cloud data into your data store. You can also load data from disparate static or streaming data sources into your data warehouse or data lake for regular reporting and analysis. By storing data in a data warehouse or data lake, you integrate information from different parts of your business and provide a common source of data for decision making.\n",
    "\n",
    "- AWS Glue simplifies many tasks when you are building a data warehouse or data lake:\n",

    "\n",
    "AWS Glue uses other AWS services to orchestrate your ETL (extract, transform, and load) jobs to build data warehouses and data lakes and generate output streams. AWS Glue calls API operations to transform your data, create runtime logs, store your job logic, and create notifications to help you monitor your job runs. The AWS Glue console connects these services into a managed application, so you can focus on creating and monitoring your ETL work. The console performs administrative and job development operations on your behalf. You supply credentials and other properties to AWS Glue to access your data sources and write to your data targets.\n",
    "\n",
    "AWS Glue takes care of provisioning and managing the resources that are required to run your workload. You don't need to create the infrastructure for an ETL tool because AWS Glue does it for you. When resources are required, to reduce startup time, AWS Glue uses an instance from its warm pool of instances to run your workload.\n",
    "\n",
    "With AWS Glue, you create jobs using table definitions in your Data Catalog. Jobs consist of scripts that contain the programming logic that performs the transformation. You use triggers to initiate jobs either on a schedule or as a result of a specified event. You determine where your target data resides and which source data populates your target. With your input, AWS Glue generates the code that's required to transform your data from source to target. You can also provide scripts in the AWS Glue console or API to process your data.\n",

    "## Serverless ETL Jobs Run in Isolation\n",
    "AWS Glue runs your ETL jobs in an Apache Spark serverless environment. AWS Glue runs these jobs on virtual resources that it provisions and manages in its own service account.\n",
    "\n",
    "AWS Glue is designed to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Segregate customer data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Protect customer data in transit and at rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Access customer data only as needed in response to customer requests, using temporary, scoped-down credentials, or with a customer's consent to IAM roles in their account.\n",
    "\n",
    "During provisioning of an ETL job, you provide input data sources and output data targets in your virtual private cloud (VPC). In addition, you provide the IAM role, VPC ID, subnet ID, and security group that are needed to access data sources and targets. For each tuple (customer account ID, IAM role, subnet ID, and security group), AWS Glue creates a new Spark environment that is isolated at the network and management level from all other Spark environments inside the AWS Glue service account.\n",
    "\n",
    "AWS Glue creates elastic network interfaces in your subnet using private IP addresses. Spark jobs use these elastic network interfaces to access your data sources and data targets. Traffic in, out, and within the Spark environment is governed by your VPC and networking policies with one exception: Calls made to AWS Glue libraries can proxy traffic to AWS Glue API operations through the AWS Glue VPC. All AWS Glue API calls are logged; thus, data owners can audit API access by enabling [AWS CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/), which delivers audit logs to your account.\n",
    "\n",
    "AWS Glue managed Spark environments that run your ETL jobs are protected with the same security practices followed by other AWS services. Those practices are listed in the __AWS Access__ section of the [Introduction to AWS Security Processes whitepaper](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/Security/Intro_Security_Practices.pdf)."

    "### AWS Glue Data Catalog\n",
    "The persistent metadata store in AWS Glue. It contains table definitions, job definitions, and other control information to manage your AWS Glue environment. Each AWS account has one AWS Glue Data Catalog per region.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classifier\n",
    "Determines the schema of your data. AWS Glue provides classifiers for common file types, such as CSV, JSON, AVRO, XML, and others. It also provides classifiers for common relational database management systems using a JDBC connection. You can write your own classifier by using a grok pattern or by specifying a row tag in an XML document.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Connection\n",
    "A Data Catalog object that contains the properties that are required to connect to a particular data store.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Crawler\n",
    "A program that connects to a data store (source or target), progresses through a prioritized list of classifiers to determine the schema for your data, and then creates metadata tables in the AWS Glue Data Catalog.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Database\n",
    "A set of associated Data Catalog table definitions organized into a logical group.\n",

    "### Development endpoint\n",
    "An environment that you can use to develop and test your AWS Glue ETL scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dynamic Frame\n",
    "A distributed table that supports nested data such as structures and arrays. Each record is self-describing, designed for schema flexibility with semi-structured data. Each record contains both data and the schema that describes that data. You can use both dynamic frames and Apache Spark dataframes in your ETL scripts, and convert between them. Dynamic frames provide a set of advanced transformations for data cleaning and ETL.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Job\n",
    "The business logic that is required to perform ETL work. It is composed of a transformation script, data sources, and data targets. Job runs are initiated by triggers that can be scheduled or triggered by events.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notebook server\n",
    "A web-based environment that you can use to run your PySpark statements. PySpark is a Python dialect for ETL programming. For more information, see Apache Zeppelin. You can set up a notebook server on a development endpoint to run PySpark statements with AWS Glue extensions.\n",

    "The metadata definition that represents your data. Whether your data is in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) file, an Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) table, or another set of data, a table defines the schema of your data. A table in the AWS Glue Data Catalog consists of the names of columns, data type definitions, partition information, and other metadata about a base dataset. The schema of your data is represented in your AWS Glue table definition. The actual data remains in its original data store, whether it be in a file or a relational database table. AWS Glue catalogs your files and relational database tables in the AWS Glue Data Catalog. They are used as sources and targets when you create an ETL job.\n",
