    "Regarding EFS, AWS Lambda support for Amazon Elastic File System now generally available. Elastic persistent file storage for Lambda functions enables entirely new use cases in the ML space. You can now use AWS Lambda to build data-intensive applications, load larger libraries and models, process larger amounts of data in a highly distributed manner, and share data across functions, containers and instances. AWS Lambda will automatically mount the file system and provide a local path to read and write data at low latency. https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/06/aws-lambda-support-for-amazon-elastic-file-system-now-generally-/\n",
