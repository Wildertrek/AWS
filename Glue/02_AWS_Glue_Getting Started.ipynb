    "For more information, see [Using DNS with your VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-dns.html).

    "\n",
    "If a job needs to run in your VPC subnet—for example, transforming data from a JDBC data store in a private subnet—AWS Glue sets up [elastic network interfaces](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_ElasticNetworkInterfaces.html) that enable your jobs to connect securely to other resources within your VPC. Each elastic network interface is assigned a private IP address from the IP address range within the subnet you specified. No public IP addresses are assigned. Security groups specified in the AWS Glue connection are applied on each of the elastic network interfaces. For more information, see [Setting Up a VPC to Connect to JDBC Data Stores](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/setup-vpc-for-glue-access.html).\n",

To access Amazon S3 from within your VPC, a [VPC endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/vpc-endpoints-s3.html) is required. If your job needs to access both VPC resources and the public internet, the VPC needs to have a Network Address Translation (NAT) gateway inside the VPC.\n",

    "For security reasons, many AWS customers run their applications within an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud environment (Amazon VPC). With Amazon VPC, you can launch Amazon EC2 instances into a virtual private cloud, which is logically isolated from other networks—including the public internet. With an Amazon VPC, you have control over its IP address range, subnets, routing tables, network gateways, and security settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "If you created your AWS account after 2013-12-04, you already have a default VPC in each AWS Region. You can immediately start using your default VPC without any additional configuration.\n",

    "Many customers have legitimate privacy and security concerns about sending and receiving data across the public internet. Customers can address these concerns by using a virtual private network (VPN) to route all Amazon S3 network traffic through their own corporate network infrastructure. However, this approach can introduce bandwidth and availability challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "VPC endpoints for Amazon S3 can alleviate these challenges. A VPC endpoint for Amazon S3 enables AWS Glue to use private IP addresses to access Amazon S3 with no exposure to the public internet. AWS Glue does not require public IP addresses, and you don't need an internet gateway, a NAT device, or a virtual private gateway in your VPC. You use endpoint policies to control access to Amazon S3. Traffic between your VPC and the AWS service does not leave the Amazon network.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create a VPC endpoint for Amazon S3, any requests to an Amazon S3 endpoint within the Region (for example, s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com) are routed to a private Amazon S3 endpoint within the Amazon network. You don't need to modify your applications running on EC2 instances in your VPC—the endpoint name remains the same, but the route to Amazon S3 stays entirely within the Amazon network, and does not access the public internet."

    "### AWS Glue Console Workflow Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "With AWS Glue, you store metadata in the AWS Glue Data Catalog. You use this metadata to orchestrate ETL jobs that transform data sources and load your data warehouse or data lake. The following steps describe the general workflow and some of the choices that you make when working with AWS Glue.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Note__\n",
    "You can follow the steps below, or you can create a workflow that automatically performs steps 1 through 3. For more information, see [Performing Complex ETL Activities Using Workflows in AWS Glue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/orchestrate-using-workflows.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Populate the AWS Glue Data Catalog with table definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the console, for persistent data stores, you can add a crawler to populate the AWS Glue Data Catalog. You can start the __Add crawler__ wizard from the list of tables or the list of crawlers. You choose one or more data stores for your crawler to access. You can also create a schedule to determine the frequency of running your crawler. For data streams, you can manually create the table definition, and define stream properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optionally, you can provide a custom classifier that infers the schema of your data. You can create custom classifiers using a grok pattern. However, AWS Glue provides built-in classifiers that are automatically used by crawlers if a custom classifier does not recognize your data. When you define a crawler, you don't have to select a classifier. For more information about classifiers in AWS Glue, see [Adding Classifiers to a Crawler](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/add-classifier.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Crawling some types of data stores requires a connection that provides authentication and location information. If needed, you can create a connection that provides this required information in the AWS Glue console.\n",
    "\n",
    "The crawler reads your data store and creates data definitions and named tables in the AWS Glue Data Catalog. These tables are organized into a database of your choosing. You can also populate the Data Catalog with manually created tables. With this method, you provide the schema and other metadata to create table definitions in the Data Catalog. Because this method can be a bit tedious and error prone, it's often better to have a crawler create the table definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information about populating the AWS Glue Data Catalog with table definitions, see [Defining Tables in the AWS Glue Data Catalog](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/tables-described.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Define a job that describes the transformation of data from source to target.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, to create a job, you have to make the following choices:\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose a table from the AWS Glue Data Catalog to be the source of the job. Your job uses this table definition to access your data source and interpret the format of your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose a table or location from the AWS Glue Data Catalog to be the target of the job. Your job uses this information to access your data store.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tell AWS Glue to generate a PySpark script to transform your source to target. AWS Glue generates the code to call built-in transforms to convert data from its source schema to target schema format. These transforms perform operations such as copy data, rename columns, and filter data to transform data as necessary. You can modify this script in the AWS Glue console.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information about defining jobs in AWS Glue, see [Authoring Jobs in AWS Glue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/author-job.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Run your job to transform your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can run your job on demand, or start it based on a one of these trigger types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A trigger that is based on a cron schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A trigger that is event-based; for example, the successful completion of another job can start an AWS Glue job.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A trigger that starts a job on demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information about triggers in AWS Glue, see [Starting Jobs and Crawlers Using Triggers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/trigger-job.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Monitor your scheduled crawlers and triggered jobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the AWS Glue console to view the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Job run details and errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Crawler run details and errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Any notifications about AWS Glue activities\n",
